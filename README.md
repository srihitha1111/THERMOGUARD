# ThermoGuard â€“ Predictive Maintenance for Temperature-Critical Medical Equipment
This project focuses on improving the reliability of temperature-sensitive medical devices by implementing an IoT-based predictive maintenance system. ThermoGuard uses real-time sensor data, Firebase integration, and AI-based anomaly detection to predict equipment failures and enable proactive intervention.

## Features
- Real-time temperature monitoring via sensor
- AI-based anomaly detection (Healthy / Warning / Critical)
- Data logging with timestamped entries
- Firebase cloud integration
- Optional SMS alerts (via Twilio)

## Built With
- ESP32, MLX90614 (Hardware)
- Arduino IDE (Firmware Development)
- Python, Flask (AI & API Backend)
- Firebase (Cloud Database)

## Status
- Hardware: Completed and Tested  
- Backend + AI Model: Completed  
- Dashboard/API Integration: In Progress
